<p>Purpose: The English Academy website aims to provide 
    resources and courses to help individuals improve their English skills. It offers a range of lessons and materials to make learning English simple and effective.
</p>

<p>Java Script: 
    The English Academy website will use JavaScript to add interactivity and smooth animations. 
    For navigation, a menu will appear when the user clicks icons and will close when they click the close button or any navigation link. 
    The site will also feature GSAP animations to create smooth and engaging transitions for various elements, such as text and images, as they fade in and slide from different directions. This will make the site feel dynamic and responsive to user interactions.
